# Web Alarm
A simple alarm build in a web page.

## Summary and use-case

The user can see and manage all the alarms that have been created. The user can also create, update and delete any given alarm on the list.
Every alarm in the list can have the following properties updated at any moment:

* If it's enabled or not.
* The hour and minute for triggering.
* Time period for triggering. AM or PM.
* The repetition mode for the alarm. Every day, once or on a given day of the week.

The page should contain a 12-hour timer setted to the current hour and minute.
When any alarm is triggered, a popup should appear with some animation indicating that the alarm set off.
